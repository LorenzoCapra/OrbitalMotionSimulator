Meta-kernel for Solar System's and Ground Stations' ESA generic kernels
==========================================================================

   This meta-kernel lists the ESA generic kernels for the main Solar System
   bodies and a selection of ground stations SPICE kernels.

   The kernels listed in this meta-kernel and the order in which
   they are listed are picked to provide the best data available and
   the most complete coverage for a generic Solar System scenario.


Usage of the Meta-kernel
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

   This file is used by the SPICE system as follows: programs that make use
   of this kernel must "load" the kernel normally during program
   initialization. Loading the kernel associates the data items with
   their names in a data structure called the "kernel pool". The SPICELIB
   routine FURNSH loads a kernel into the pool.

   The kernels listed below can be obtained from the ESA SPICE FTP server:

      ftp://spiftp.esac.esa.int/data/SPICE/esa_generic_kernels/kernels/


Implementation Notes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

   It is recommended that users make a local copy of this file and
   modify the value of the PATH_VALUES keyword to point to the actual
   location of the BepiColombo SPICE data set's ``data'' directory on
   their system. Replacing ``/'' with ``\'' and converting line
   terminators to the format native to the user's system may also be
   required if this meta-kernel is to be used on a non-UNIX workstation.
